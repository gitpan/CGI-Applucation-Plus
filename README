CGI-Application-Plus README File
================================


Description
-----------

This module is a complete new stand alone reimplementation of C<CGI::Application> module (i.e. it is not a subclass). It adds several new features to your CGI::Application implementation, maintaining intact the old ones, so if some new feature is not useful to you, just use the old way that still works.
